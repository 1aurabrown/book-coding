<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The Book Liberation Manifesto is an exploration of publishing outside of current corporate constraints and beyond the confines of book piracy. We believe that knowledge should be in free circulation to benefit humankind, which means an equitable and vibrant economy to support publishing, instead of the prevailing capitalist hand-me-down system of Sisyphean economic sustainability. Readers and books have been forced into pirate libraries, while sales channels have been monopolised by the big Internet giants which exact extortionate fees from publishers. We have three proposals. First, publications should be free-at-the-point-of-reading under a variety of open intellectual property regimes. Second, they should become fully digital — in order to facilitate ready reuse, distribution, algorithmic and computational use. Finally, Open Source software for publishing should be treated as public infrastructure, with sustained research and investment. The result of such robust infrastructures will mean lower costs for manufacturing and faster publishing lifecycles, so that publishers and publics will be more readily able to afford to invent new futures.</p>

<p>The Hybrid Publishing Consortium (HPC) is a research network which is part of the Hybrid Publishing Lab and works to support Open Source software infrastructures. The HPC wishes to present practical solutions to the problems with the current stage of the evolution of the book. The HPC sees a glaring necessity for new types of publications, books which are enhanced with interfaces in order to take advantage of computation and digital networks. The initial sections of this manifesto will outline the current problems with the digital development of the book, with reference to stages in its historical evolution. We will then go on to present a framework for dealing with the problems in the later sections.</p>
<p>Now that there are floods of Open Access content for users to sort through, the book must develop to take on fresh interface design challenges – for improving reading, but also to support a wide range of communities. The latter include art, design, museums and the Digital Humanities groups, for all of whom video, audio, hyper-images, code, text, simulations and game sequences are needed.</p>
<p>HPC’s view is that current technology provisions in publishing are costly, inefficient and need a step-up in R&amp;D. To support technical, open source infrastructures for publishing we have identified the ‘Platform Independent Document Type’ as key. Our objective is to contribute to the working implementation of an open standards based and transmedia structured document for multi-format publishing. With structured documents and accompanying systems publishers can lower costs, increase revenues and support innovation.</p>
<p>HPC is about building public open source software infrastructures for publishing to support the free-flow of knowledge – aka book liberation. Our mission statement is:</p>
<blockquote>‘Every publication, in a universal format, available for free in real-time.’</blockquote>
<p>This is our reworking of Amazon’s mission statement for its Kindle product:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Operations-Inside/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=203044011">‘Every book ever printed, in any language, all available in less than 60 seconds.’</blockquote>
<p>Currently digital publishing is dead in the water because for digital multi-format publications prohibitive amounts of time and costs are needed for rights clearance: the permissions required for each new format, the necessary signed contracts etc. So something has to give. For the scholarly community, Open Access academic publishing has fixed these problems with open licences, but other publishing sectors outside of academia remain frozen by restrictive licensing designed for print media.</p>
<p>Our efforts in building technical infrastructures will be wasted if content continues to be locked in, and this is where HPC's issue becomes as much a political as a technical problem. Open intellectual property licences, such as Creative Commons, are not enough on their own. Something else is needed if we want to support the free flow of knowledge: a way to financially support the publishers and the chain of skilled workers who are involved in publication productions. This can be either by a form of market metrics or by fair collections and redistribution methods, with the latter involving a little less fussing around than some market measurement. Open Access has meant publishers are still paid; it is simply that the point of payment has moved away from the reader to another point in the publishing process, where the free flow of knowledge is not hampered.</p>
<h2>2. Broken Workflows</h2>

<p>Publishing is the largest creative industry in terms of revenue. For example, in the EU there are 64,000 publishers with total annual revenues of 23€ billion.<span class="footnote">European Commission, Joint Research Centre. Institute for Prospective Technological Studies <a href="http://is.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pages/ISG/documents/BookReportwithcovers.pdf">http://is.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pages/ISG/documents/BookReportwithcovers.pdf</a></span> The top 20% of publishers generate 80% of the revenues which, if EU figures are taken as a guide, means they are slicing off a cool 18€ billion annually. In the EU wealthier publishers can afford digital workflow systems which are prohibitively expensive for others, starting at 100,000 euro per annum in end-to-end costs. The 51,000 publishers who make up bottom 80%, with average revenues of less than three million euro, get by with various hand cranked custom solutions. It is these smaller publishers and all the self publishers, authors and institutions that we need to help.</p>
<p>A high end digital publishing system involves workflow integration and dynamic publishing features: multi-format publishing; standardised markup; rights management; asset management; reading metrics; automated distribution; metadata management; revisioning; document management; and payment systems, etc. It is notable that high end publishing systems continue to rely for many of these processes on offshored cheap labor.</p>
<p>Take one part of the workflow, multi-format digital publishing, which involves publishing to eBook, HTML, PDF, App and XML or other markup. Each of these formats has to be ‘Publication Ready Output’ for each distribution channel, which involves more than merely making the appropriate file type per format. We can see that the problems here are multi-format design layouts and revisioning. Currently a typical publisher would use a tool chain most likely comprising Microsoft Word and Adobe Creative Suite, neither of which are capable of making layout designs and handling revisions for multi-format in any practical or efficient manner. In this conventional scenario the workflow for each format requires a separate workflow for layout design, adding a new cost overhead for each format. And then on the side of revisioning, for example adding last minute edits, the current tool chain, again, involves each format being a separate workflow, so that updating a simple typo means editing four or five different files, which adds costs and drives editors crazy. These two factors alone – out of many more – make the digital publishing workflow uneconomic and unviable for the publisher. The net result is that publishers miss out on revenues and find it nearly impossible to entertain thoughts of innovating their processes or product lines.</p>
<p>There are many new online services with better and more integrated workflows, but they need more support in terms of development to reach maturity before publishers switch systems. The risks to the publishers of these new services is they will close down, due to insufficiently robust technology, or because of other problems, which means they are not viable for an industry with hard and fixed deadlines.</p>
<p>It is not solely key applications that are letting publishers down, it is also standards and technologies. It remains the case that common standards for document markups like HTML and EPUB cannot properly cope with basic publication components, including footnotes, styling in running headers, pagination and annotation. Infrastructural technologies are also unavailable as public services for reuse by individuals or businesses: examples include public web search engine indexes, cost free micropayment and Optical Character Recognition. Each of these areas does feature attempts and programmes to address the issues, but these have serious flaws or unresolved problems. Specifically, a public search engine index is only just being proposed in the EU as the Open Web Index<span class="footnote">Open Web Index <a href="http://openwebindex.eu">http://openwebindex.eu</a></span> as proposed by Dirk Lewandowski of the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, for micropayments BitCoin remains unviable while its value is so volatile, due to lack of regulation over speculators, while OCR projects like Google’s ‘Tesseract OCR’<span class="footnote">Tesseract OCR <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/</a></span> involve Google maintaining privacy over its word pattern recognition for scanning in Google Books.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there are many groups working on improvement on a variety of areas in the technology tool chain as public infrastructure: W3C, International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF), research councils and knowledge infrastructure groups; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, or DFG), Jisc, foundations and, most importantly, Open Source initiatives (e.g., The Libre Graphics Meeting) and the startup sector.</p>
